# Claim Harvesting

A claim you never wrote down is a claim nothing will verify. Harvesting is the load-bearing first
move of the gate: its output bounds everything downstream. Every escaped blocker in the incident
that motivated this bundle was a place where a *belief* — stated or merely held — was confidently
false.

## Two harvests, UNIONed never intersected

- **Explicit** (`claim-harvester`): what the change *says* it does.
- **Implicit** (`purpose-inquisitor`): what the change *exists for*, even when unstated.

Run them **cold and independent**, then UNION. Inference can only **add** claims; it can never
remove one the explicit harvest found. Intersection would silently drop the most valuable claims —
the implicit safety ones nobody wrote down.

## Explicit sources, in yield order

1. **Docstrings and inline comments in the changed code — HIGHEST YIELD.** Comments encode the
   author's *belief*. `# idempotent MERGE makes replay a no-op` is a claim. The confidently-false
   comment sits right next to the wrong line more often than anywhere else.
2. **Commit messages** — the change's own summary.
3. **PR / branch description** — the narrative told to reviewers.
4. **Linked design / spec docs** — the promises the change was meant to keep.

Read the actual sources (`git log`, `git diff`, `read_file`, `grep`). Never reason from priors about
what a change "probably" claims.

## Implicit inference: from purpose to promised property

For each change ask, in order:
1. **What breaks in the world if this change didn't exist?** → the condition it manages.
2. **What must stay true while that condition is handled?** → the implicit claim.
3. **Is that a safety/integrity property** (corruption / loss / inversion / staleness)? → then it is
   almost certainly load-bearing and almost certainly untested (tests covered the liveness the
   commit mentioned, not the integrity the change was *for*).

Ground every inferred claim in a specific **basis** (the exact thing you derived it from). A prior
design-council verdict is a rich source: each addressed FAIL/CONCERN is an implicit claim that "the
concern was handled in the code" — exactly the promises made in prose and under-delivered in source.

## What counts as load-bearing

Keep claims whose falseness would matter: guarantees, prevention, bounds, invariants, coverage.
Discard prose that asserts nothing testable ("cleaned up", "improved readability").

## The claim contract (shared source of truth — both harvesters obey it)

### Rule 1 — GRANULARITY: build the (mechanism × property) grid FIRST (mandatory output step)

**Before writing any claim text**, produce the grid — this is a required, explicit step, not a
mental note:

1. **Enumerate the changed mechanisms** = the concrete symbols the diff adds/edits: function, class,
   method, and field/parameter names (e.g. `schema_health`, `max_delete`, `_handle_exhausted_batch`,
   `iteration_count`). Take them **verbatim from the diff** — they are line-stable discriminators and
   the only source of per-claim specificity in the template. Do not invent mechanisms; do not omit a
   changed one.
2. **Cross each mechanism with the property enum** (exactly these seven, no others):
   `corruption`, `loss`, `inversion`, `staleness`, `bound_quantity`, `idempotence`, `coverage`.
3. **Emit EXACTLY ONE claim per OCCUPIED cell** — a cell is occupied iff the change makes a
   load-bearing promise about that (mechanism × property). No more, no less. **The grid IS the claim
   set** — this is what makes the count reproducible (it killed the 54-vs-85 run-to-run spread).

**Atomicity check (per cell):** *"Can ONE counter-case falsify exactly this cell and nothing else?"*
If falsifying a candidate needs **two independent counter-cases**, it is two cells (split). A single
mechanism whose single load-bearing line enforces one property is **one** cell even if the source
sentence is compound. Two different mechanisms guarding the same property are two cells (the symbol
differs). Multiple *code paths* into ONE mechanism guarding ONE property are **one** cell — path
coverage is the chokepoint-mapper lens's job, not a second claim.

**Worked example (grid from a diff hunk).** Diff adds a validator on `max_delete` and a
`schema_health` read that is *missing* on the write path:
```
- def apply(max_delete: int | None = None): ...
+ def apply(max_delete: int | None = Field(default=None, ge=1)): ...   # symbol: max_delete
  def _write_batch(...):                                               # symbol: _write_batch
+     # (no schema_health read here)
```
Mechanisms = {`max_delete`, `_write_batch`}. Occupied cells:
- (`max_delete` × `bound_quantity`) — it promises to cap the count → **1 claim**
- (`max_delete` × `inversion`) — it promises a hostile value can't invert the cap → **1 claim**
- (`_write_batch` × `corruption`) — the write path promises not to corrupt while degraded → **1 claim**
Three occupied cells → exactly three claims, every run.

### Rule 2 — PHRASING: the rigid claim template (fixes text AND type per cell)

Every claim's `text` MUST be **exactly** this three-slot template — present tense, active voice,
symbol first, nothing else (no adjectives, no negation words, no free-form restatement):

```
<mechanism_symbol> <controlled_verb> <controlled_property_object>
```

The `<verb>` and `<property_object>` are **NOT free** — they are fixed by the cell's property via
this closed table (this is the whole degrees-of-freedom reduction). Choosing the cell fixes the
predicate **and** the claim `type` simultaneously:

| property (cell) | controlled_verb | controlled_property_object | claim `type` | example `text` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `corruption` | `preserves` | `integrity` | `safety` | `_write_batch preserves integrity` |
| `loss` | `persists` | `writes` | `safety` | `flush_barrier persists writes` |
| `inversion` | `rejects` | `inversion` | `safety` | `max_delete rejects inversion` |
| `staleness` | `refreshes` | `state` | `temporal` | `schema_health refreshes state` |
| `bound_quantity` | `caps` | `quantity` | `quantitative` | `max_delete caps quantity` |
| `idempotence` | `deduplicates` | `effects` | `concurrency` | `iteration_count deduplicates effects` |
| `coverage` | `covers` | `behavior` | `coverage` | `tag_legacy_pooled_iterations covers behavior` |

- **Controlled verb set (closed — the ONLY verbs allowed in `text`):**
  `preserves`, `persists`, `rejects`, `refreshes`, `caps`, `deduplicates`, `covers`.
- **Controlled property-object set (closed — the ONLY objects allowed in `text`):**
  `integrity`, `writes`, `inversion`, `state`, `quantity`, `effects`, `behavior`.
- **`<mechanism_symbol>`** is the exact diff symbol. Backtick it or not — the normalizer folds a
  backticked span and a bare `snake_case`/`camelCase` token to the same code token, so both converge.
- **Type is fixed by the property**, per the table's `type` column. The safety-typing bias (F-8) is
  expressed *through the property choice*: if the forbidden violation is a corruption / loss /
  inversion harm, pick that property → the type is `safety` automatically. Do not re-decide the type
  freehand — the id hash includes `type`, so free-typed variance would fork the id.

> **Why this is byte-canonical against the normalizer.** The template contains only a code symbol +
> two plain lowercase tokens, none of which are fillers (`_FILLERS`) and none of which the normalizer
> stems or reorders. So `normalize_text("max_delete caps quantity")` and
> `normalize_text("`max_delete` caps quantity")` both yield exactly `max_delete caps quantity` — the
> template normalizes to itself (modulo symbol casefold). Mentally verify any claim before recording:
> its three tokens should survive normalization unchanged.

**Specificity lives in the un-hashed fields, not the text.** The template `text` is terse on purpose
— it is the *identity anchor*. The concrete detail (the exact line, the counter-value, the belief)
goes in `quote` (explicit) / `basis` (implicit) and `source` (`file:line`), which are **excluded**
from the `claim_id` hash and so cost no reproducibility. The downstream verifier reads the real code
anyway.

### The canonicalization pass (second pass — mandatory, cheap)

Do not emit the template one-shot from prose; that is where free-form phrasing leaks back in.
Instead, for each occupied cell, run this short pass **before** `add_claim`:
1. **Draft** the claim in your own words while reading the source (find it).
2. **Map** it to its `(mechanism × property)` cell — name the symbol and the single property.
3. **Rewrite** to the template using the fixed tables above (verb + object + type from the cell).
4. **Re-check** the rewrite still denotes that exact cell (symbol correct, property correct) and that
   its three tokens normalize unchanged. Only then `add_claim`.
Two runs that reach the same cell therefore emit the same three tokens and the same type → the same
`claim_id`, by construction.

### Suppression guard (the R-1 flip side — do not let the grid drop a real claim)

The grid's risk is the mirror of over-collapse: a real claim lost because no cell was drawn for it.
Two mandatory safeguards:
- **A missed changed symbol is a missed claim.** Enumerate mechanisms mechanically from the diff;
  never skip a changed function/class/field.
- **A load-bearing claim that fits NO property cell is FLAGGED, never silently dropped.** If a change
  makes a real promise that none of the seven properties captures, record it with the nearest
  property **and** note the mismatch in `quote`/`basis` so the human sees it at Gate A. Do not invent
  an eighth property (that reintroduces the variance this rule exists to remove), and do not discard
  it as "doesn't fit."

### R-6 — this contract and the normalizer are bound by a test

The controlled verb set, property-object set, property→type map, negation/bound tokens, and
boilerplate phrases above are **mirrored and asserted** in
`modules/tool-claim-ledger/tests/test_vocab_drift.py`. If you add, rename, or retire any controlled
verb / property object / property mapping here, you MUST update that test's `CONTRACT_*` mirrors and
(where relevant) `identity.py`'s `_NEVER_STRIP` / `_FILLERS` / `_FILLER_PHRASES` in the **same
change**, or the drift guard fails. Residual prose that still uses negation (`no`/`not`/`never`/
`cannot`) or bounds (`at most N`/`at least N`/`exactly N`/`under N`) — e.g. in `quote`/`basis` or a
human edit at Gate A — keeps those controlled tokens, and the normalizer's `_NEVER_STRIP` guard
protects them.

## Typing — and the safety bias (F-8)

Type each claim: `correspondence | safety | quantitative | temporal | concurrency | coverage`. The
type drives lens routing, probe eligibility, and the gate's second limb.

**Bias toward `safety`:** when a claim contains prevention/integrity language — *prevent, cannot,
won't, never, no <bad thing>, guard, ensure no, refuse* — default it to `safety`. A false `safety`
costs one extra probe; a safety claim mistyped as `correspondence` silently escapes the strongest
gate limb. Bias toward the stricter limb.

## The zero-claim rule (S-8)

If you find no claims, say so explicitly — never invent them. A zero-claim harvest becomes an
**INDETERMINATE** gate result, never a PASS. An empty checklist is a harvest failure, not a clean
bill of health. Note where you looked so the human can supply a commit message or linked doc.
